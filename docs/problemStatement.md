# Automations & Multi-Agent Systems — Problem Statement

## Background
Planning a trip sounds simple at first, but in practice it quickly becomes overwhelming.

A traveler may have a request like:
> "Plan a 5-day trip to Dubai. $3,000 budget. Love food and modern architecture, hate crowds."

To fulfill that well, we need to combine many different kinds of work:
- Understanding the traveler’s goals
- Researching destinations and attractions
- Comparing hotels and transport options
- Staying within budget
- Checking whether the final itinerary actually matches the request

## Objective
Design a simple Travel Planning Multi-Agent System that can automatically turn a short travel request into a useful trip plan.

The goal is not to build a perfect travel product, but to show how multiple specialized AI agents can work together on a real-world problem that product managers can easily understand.

## Real-World Problem to Solve: "AI Travel Planner"
A user gives a natural-language travel request such as:
> Plan a 5-day trip to Dubai. $3,000 budget. Love food and modern architecture, hate crowds.

The system should produce:
- A day-by-day trip outline
- Suggested neighborhoods / areas to stay
- Travel logistics within the city
- Budget-friendly recommendations
- A final itinerary that respects the user’s preferences and constraints

## Multi-Agent System Design

### 1. Orchestrator Agent
**Role:** Creates the master plan, assigns work, and combines outputs into the final itinerary.

**What it does:**
- Reads the user request
- Extracts key constraints:
  - **Destination:** Dubai
  - **Duration:** 5 days
  - **Budget:** $3,000
  - **Preferences:** Food, modern architecture
  - **Avoidances:** Crowds
- Delegates tasks to the other agents
- Synthesizes the final travel plan

### 2. Destination Research Agent
**Role:** Finds the best places, experiences, and food ideas based on the traveler’s preferences.

**Possible inputs:**
- Web search
- Travel guides
- Restaurant reviews
- Attraction summaries

**What it does:**
- Recommends neighborhoods, architectural landmarks, food districts, and local experiences
- Suggests less-crowded options where possible
- Identifies “must-do” vs “nice-to-have” items

**Example output:**
- Best quiet architectural viewpoints in Dubai
- Authentic food neighborhoods
- Off-peak or less-crowded experiences

### 3. Logistics Agent
**Role:** Handles the practical side of moving and staying.

**Possible inputs:**
- Hotel APIs or sample hotel data
- Metro routes / transit info
- Maps / distance tools

**What it does:**
- Suggests where to stay in Dubai (e.g., Downtown Dubai vs. Dubai Marina)
- Estimates travel time between locations
- Recommends how to move around (Metro, Taxis)
- Builds a realistic sequence for each day

**Example output:**
- 3 nights in Downtown Dubai, 2 nights in Dubai Marina
- Metro / Taxi routes between districts
- Day plans that reduce backtracking

### 4. Budget Agent
**Role:** Ensures the plan stays within budget.

**Possible inputs:**
- Currency conversion (AED to USD)
- Estimated hotel costs
- Food and transport price ranges
- Attraction pricing

**What it does:**
- Breaks the budget into categories: Stay, Transport, Food, Activities
- Flags when the plan becomes too expensive
- Suggests cheaper alternatives

**Example output:**
- Estimated total spend: $2,650
- Hotel cost too high in Downtown Dubai → suggest alternate area like Al Barsha or Deira

### 5. Review Agent
**Role:** Validates the final itinerary before it is shown to the user.

**What it checks:**
- Does the itinerary fit into 5 days?
- Is it focused on Dubai?
- Is it within the $3,000 budget?
- Does it align with “food + modern architecture”?
- Does it try to avoid crowded experiences?
- Is the plan realistic from a travel-time perspective?

*This agent acts like a quality checker before the result is delivered.*
